class Solution:
    def fourSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:

#         The provided code defines a class Solution with a method fourSum that aims to find all unique quadruplets in a list of integers nums that sum up to a given target value. The fourSum method leverages two helper functions, kSum and twoSum, to achieve this.

# The kSum function is a recursive function designed to find all unique k-tuples in the list nums that sum up to the specified target. It starts by initializing an empty list res to store the results. If the input list nums is empty, it returns the empty result list immediately. The function then calculates the average value of the target divided by k to determine if it's feasible to find such k-tuples within the given list. If the smallest value in nums is greater than this average or the largest value is smaller, it returns the empty result list, as it's impossible to reach the target sum with the given constraints.

# When k equals 2, the function delegates the task to the twoSum function, which is specifically optimized for finding pairs of numbers that sum up to the target. For larger values of k, the function iterates through the list nums, ensuring that it skips duplicate values to avoid redundant results. For each unique value, it recursively calls kSum with the remaining part of the list and a reduced target, appending the current value to each subset found by the recursive call.

# The twoSum function is a straightforward implementation to find all unique pairs in nums that sum up to the target. It uses a set s to keep track of the numbers seen so far. As it iterates through nums, it checks if the complement of the current number (i.e., target - nums[i]) exists in the set. If it does, it adds the pair to the result list res, ensuring that it skips duplicates by checking the last added pair. The function then adds the current number to the set and continues the iteration.

# Finally, the fourSum method sorts the input list nums and calls the kSum function with k set to 4, initiating the process to find all quadruplets that sum up to the target. The sorting step is crucial as it allows the algorithm to efficiently skip duplicates and apply the average value check.

        def kSum(nums: List[int], target: int, k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
            res = []

            # If we have run out of numbers to add, return res.
            if not nums:
                return res

            # There are k remaining values to add to the sum. The
            # average of these values is at least target // k.
            average_value = target // k

            # We cannot obtain a sum of target if the smallest value
            # in nums is greater than target // k or if the largest
            # value in nums is smaller than target // k.
            if average_value < nums[0] or nums[-1] < average_value:
                return res

            if k == 2:
                return twoSum(nums, target)

            for i in range(len(nums)):
                if i == 0 or nums[i - 1] != nums[i]:
                    for subset in kSum(nums[i + 1 :], target - nums[i], k - 1):
                        res.append([nums[i]] + subset)

            return res

        def twoSum(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
            res = []
            s = set()

            for i in range(len(nums)):
                if len(res) == 0 or res[-1][1] != nums[i]:
                    if target - nums[i] in s:
                        res.append([target - nums[i], nums[i]])
                s.add(nums[i])
